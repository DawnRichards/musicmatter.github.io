		    <p>It is a well-known fact that you gain more useful skills playing in a group than you do practicing solo, also that, ultimately, you need a professional teacher to give you feedback on your playing. If you can’t get out the house or you live in a very remote area, you might not have this option. However, with new technology It might be possible to learn an instrument and play with bands/groups from your home.</p>
		  
		    <p>One research project that one of my lecturers is leading is called the Online Orchestra whose “aim is to design a way of making music online that enables a meaningful and enjoyable musical experience by amateur musicians and children who live in geographically remote communities”. They are also trying to keep the equipment fairly cheap so as to allow people from all walks of life to play together. The have worked out a way to control the latency so that they can work around it. For example, they can make the latency a crotchet length and this means they can write music around it.</p>
