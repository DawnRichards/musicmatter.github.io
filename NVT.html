		    <p>Before the invention of the record player the only way to listen to music was to go to a concert, usually preserved only for the rich. But, overtime styles like folk grew as a more informal type of music that was more open to the masses. At this stage, if you were lucky enough to be able to practice music you only knew the music you got taught. It was not easy to learn about any other types of music because there was no way to this is why tradition was very strong.</p>
		  
		    <p>In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the Record player which changed the music industry. However, the record could only fit about 3 minutes of music on each side. This was not always enough for a classical piece. Even if there was a 6-minute piece of music, there would need to be suitable break 3 minutes in so that the person playing it could turn the record over. There was always a compromise to be made with how much music could be fitted into a record. The slower it turned the more music you could fit onto it but in doing this the quality went down. Consequently, if you decided you wanted better quality you would be able to fit less music on the record. Early records where made out of shellac and where very fragile. This made it very hard to transport. The tape was much more portable than the record â€“ more could be fitted on it, but it could easily break when winding back.</p>
		  
		    <p>Tape sales took over vinyl in about 1983, but when Walkman was released in 1979, it made listening to music much easier and very portable. The tape inside was still quite fragile and you had to wind them back if you wanted to start at the beginning. However, the amount of music you could put on them had increased to up to 75 minutes. This was perfect for classical music as the limit was high and there was no need to split the music in half if it did not need to be. The sound quality, however was not as good as the CD, which came next.</p>
