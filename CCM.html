		  <p>When someone writes a 3.30-minute song in their bedroom they have a 
		  few choices of how to get it onto the internet. They can put it on YouTube
		  (probably the easiest), Soundcloud, Bandcamp and many other streaming 
		  services. If they market this song well and then add more to go with it 
		  then they could end up earning some money from it.</p>
		  
		  <p>However, if someone writes a contemporary classical piece that is 5
		  minutes long there are fewer places online that will accommodate it, 
		  and even then, it may not get the help from the algorithm of the site 
		  if it is longer than a normal length pop song. From what I have experienced 
		  the best place to put a classical style piece is YouTube where watchers are
		  more used to watching longer videos.</p>
		  
		  <p>If you look on Spotify there is a section for classical music, but the 
		  number of people following those playlists is between 100,000 to 200,000, 
		  however, if you look at the playlists of pop songs there are 300,000 to 600,000 
		  people following them. Some of these even have millions of people following 
		  them e.g. “Songs to Sing in the Shower”. This is a prime example that although 
		  you can put classical music on these platforms they simply don’t have the audience 
		  of people who want to listen to this kind of music. This is fair enough, because 
		  that is not what their main interest is, but where do we, as classical musicians 
		  put our music?</p>

		  
		  <p>After a bit of searching I found a few sites that allow you to stream 
		  classical music for free (with ads obviously). 
		  One of them is <a href="https://operavision.eu/en" target="_blank">OperaVision</a>
		  who, as the name suggest, mainly focus on operas which seem to have been 
		  livestreamed and then imbedded onto the website. They have managed to make 
		  the website very friendly to new-comers to opera with a link “New To Opera?” 
		  with a bunch of information behind that including an explanation of “Opera 
		  for Beginners”. This is a good place for new listeners to get to grips with 
		  opera, but it is still not the Spotify of the classical world.</p>
		  
		  <p>The only website I found completely free, with lots of choice of music 
		  was <a href="https://www.accuradio.com/" target="_blank">AccuRadio</a>. 
		  They have a very wide range of music, but more importantly 
		  to us, there is a fair amount of classical music and a few modern classical 
		  pieces. I feel like this website is trying to be the next Spotify which, I 
		  think, is not a great business model as there are so many big companies crowding 
		  the market already. However, it does seem to be fairly easy to put music up 
		  onto AccuRadio so could be a good option for modern classical composers.</p>
		  
		  <p>Another site I liked the look of was
		  <a href="https://www.primephonic.com/" target="_blank">Primephonic</a>. This was not free 
		  but after a 30 day free trial it is £14.99 a month which is a pretty 
		  good price for an all classical music streaming service. You can also 
		  buy downloads of your favourite piece or album, quite like iTunes. The 
		  only problem with this is that it seems that to be able to get music onto 
		  the site you have to be connected to a label, which is fine if you’re with 
		  one but for the amateur composer it will be harder.</p>
		 
		
		  <p>I think Soundcloud could be a great place for amateurs to put up their 
		  classical style pieces. It is a place full of new music with, what seems 
		  to me to be, very little bias on the shorter pop songs, except the listener’s 
		  attention spans which will always be a problem for a composer who writes 
		  anything more than 3 minutes (but that is a different conversation to have).</p>
		  
		  <p>In conclusion, there are places that you can put your music online, but 
		  you have to make sure that you choose the right one for your style of writing. 
		  After writing this I think Soundcloud is a good place to start for a classical 
		  composer, but that is up to you, the writer, to decide for yourself.</p>
