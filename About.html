		  <p>Dawn Richards has been playing the violin since she was six and achieved 
		  grade 8 violin in 2015. She also has grade 8 singing and grade 5 theory. During
		  her time at school Dawn was involved in many clubs, including two choirs, 
		  leading the string chamber group and school orchestra, training a younger 
		  string group, and other ad hoc groups. As a music prefect and scholar, she 
		  has also been involved in stage managing concerts and assisting the teachers 
		  generally within the department.</p>
		  
		  
		  
		  <h2>About Me</h2>
		  
		  <p>In the summer of 2014 Dawn completed two weeks of work experience at
		  the artist management company, IMG Artists, where she was able to witness
		  the organization that goes on behind the big classical music stars.</p>
		
		  <p>For a few years before she went to university Dawn studied the violin 
		  with Andrew Bernardi, who is part of the professional staff at Trinity
		  College London, and gave her a big insight as to what it takes to be a 
		  great musician with both technical work and business now how. During that 
		  time she played with Andrewâ€™s String Academy, which encourages gifted and 
		  talented string musicians in Sussex to play together to a high standard in 
		  prestigious concerts.</p>
		  
		  <p>Dawn is now studying music at Falmouth university. Here she is being exposed to many different styles of music. This gives her the ability to develop her own style of music by incorporating the techniques and genres she enjoys. She is currently enjoying composing for different groups of instruments and incorporating different styles into.</p>
